# Ner Problem VSLP 2021
## Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of tagging entities in text with their corresponding type, which is an important task in the field of Natural Language Processing. In this report, we used XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), which is a transformer-based multilingual masked language model pre-trained on text in 100 languages. We presented a simple approach to entity extraction, while integrating the model into an annotation engine called Doccano for automatic labeling. Besides, we also used LIME and AllenNLP to interpret the model's predictions. All results were evaluated on the VLSP 2021 dataset, which we customized to fit the purpose of the problem.
